# Milestone 2: Gathering Information & Planning
As per the assignment, our product is a general tracking app. 

## Updated Target Users
We identified three (3) target users for this app to be:
1. Students who want to reach strength goals through exercise.
2. Students who want to reduce everyday finance spending and meet specific budgeting goals.
3. Students who want to reduce their time spent on social media to be productive.

We chose these target users because they are easily accessible on a college campus, and we hypothesize the users' target desires are common problems among students.


## Research Methods

We conducted **user interviews** with students who want to reach *strength goals* and *reduce everyday finances*. Interview-style data collection allowed us to learn about the users' personal experiences and perspectives with these intentional and measureable activites. 

On the other hand, we conducted **field studies** with our users who wanted to *reduce time spent on social media*. We chose this method rather than an interview because users often do not meausre and are unaware of time they spend on social media. 

### Interviews
See our [interview questions](interviews/interview-protocol.md) and user responses in the following links:

* [Strength Goals Interviews](interviews/fitness.md)
* [Finance Goals Interviews](interviews/finance.md)
* [Social Media Field Studies](interviews/socialmedia.md)


## Analysis
We affinity diagramed our data to sort and narrow down information we gathered from users. 

### Strength Tracking

From those wanting to track strength/fitness progress, we learned:
1. Users follow pre-made workout plans throughout their workouts and log progress during and after sessions.
2. Users mainly use text to record data through basic apps such as Notes or Excel.
3. Users have issues with fitness apps that:
		- Have too many steps
		- Are not customizable
		- Lack visuals (diagrams, photos, etc).

### Finance Tracking

From those wanting to track everyday finances, we learned:
1. Users *do* want to reduce spending, but many fail to do so because tracking finances takes time and effort.
2. To check spending, users look at their bank statements.
3. Users' overall goal is to gain financial independence.

### Social Media Use

From watching users use social media, we learned:
1. When studying, users keep social media and academic tabs open at the same time on their laptop browswers.
2. If somebody near the user opened social media or checked their phone, the user would do the same.
3. Users check social media for a few minutes at a time, many times throughout the session.

## Value Propositions
Compared to alternatives, our application: 
* Provides a way to keep all information relevant to tracking centralized in a single application.
  * The tradeoff for this feature is that there are less activity-specific features.
* Draws from tools and interfaces that people are already familiar with, so it will be easy to use.
* Is more portable than a notebook, so users can track on the go!
* Presents information in an organized and accessible user interface that minimizes the user’s time and energy that would normally be spent sorting raw data on their own.
* Is better than doing nothing because our app guides users to think about their goals and lets them track their journey. By taking a few moments in their day to track, the user can feel more organized and like they are actively progressing.



## Personas

### Fitness Tracking – John
* John is a male junior at Cornell University. 
* He’s SUPER into fitness and wants to stay in shape for health and aesthetics. He maintains both long a short term exercise goals, but more specifically, he wants to be able to: bench 260 lbs, deadlift 450 lbs, and squat 325 lbs within the year.

## Scenarios

### Fitness – John
John is a weightlifter who practices his bench press, deadlift, and squat 4 times a week.  While he’s made tremendous progress, he still falling short of his summer goals, so he’s trying to track his weightlifting progress to keep him on a strict regimen.

While he’s working out, John inputs the reps, weight, and sets of each exercise he completes into the Tracker app.  To check how much progress he made, he has the app display a chart visualizing the changes in these values for each lift over the past month. With a visual representation of the progress he’s making, John feels confident he’ll reach his goal as he planned. 


### Finance – David
David has a job at GreenStar where he earns $11 an hour. He doesn’t work many hours (8 per week) so his paychecks aren’t very heavy. He also gets paid every two weeks which means he is often anxiously waiting for payday.

During the day, David has to choose where to go out for lunch. He is used to going to his favorite places which are pricey, but he has been trying to be more conscious of his spending. As he is deciding where to go to lunch, he opens his Tracker app to see how much he has been spending over the week. He looks at a progress line graph under his Lunch Spending tracker and sees that he has spent more than usual on lunch over the course of the week. He decides he has been spending too much money on lunch, so he chooses a cheaper spot for lunch instead.


### Social Media - Nicole
Nicole is sitting in Olin Library on her laptop. It’s October and she’s nervous because her CS 2110 project grades so far were not up to her standards, and she has her first prelim coming up. 

After working on her project for a while, she decides to take a 15 minute break by scrolling through Facebook. She makes a note of the time, 4:00pm, and begins going through Facebook. All of a sudden Nicole checks her clock and sees its 4:45pm! She sadly opens her tracking app, opens her Facebook Tracker, and logs 45 minutes. 



## Project Themes
To avoid feature-creep, we have decided the following most important features for our tracker:
* Customizability
  * Users are allowed to define the behavior they want to track, choose the metrics that will be used to track it.
  * Users can group behaviors into larger categories.
* Data Organization 
  * The app automatically generates a graphical representation of the user entered data.
  * Organizes data into log entries and sorts chronologically.
  * Supports ability to upload pictures and take notes.
* Encouraging User Experience 
  * Friendly and encouraging dialogue to keep users engaged. 
  * Reminds user of goals.
