* (Do you have a specific budget for spending? Are you trying to reduce or maintain your current spending?)
* Currently trying to reduce her spending because she keeps going over budget for the week 

Do you currently track your everyday finances? If so, how? 
* Not really thinks she probably should but gets busy and doesnt really want to really see how much she’s actually spending a lot of the time bc she knows it’s too much
* “I do check around every 2 or 3 weeks but It should really be on a more day to day basis if I want to remember to not buy things”
* Checks using chase bank app - has list of most recent transactions with time amount and current balance after that transaction 

What intervals do you use while tracking your spending (ex. Money spent daily, weekly…) 
* Every few weeks

Why do you track your budgeting? Or why don’t you?
* Dont track because busy and forgets / she doesn’t have a good method for it
 
What are some pain points you face when trying to track your budgeting goals? 
* She doesn’t really track them regularly she usually just looks at bank account and sees if balance is near what she expected or is less or more than expected
* If it’s more than expected she scrolls through recent transactions

Have you tried to track your spending in the past? What was your experience like?
* Not really- spending has never been that big of a problem that she needed to track or she wouldn’t have enough

Is there anything you can think of that would help you reach your goals?
* Reminders on a daily basis of how much she had left budgeted for the week or 2 weeks 
* Tracking overall might help bc currently doesn’t have any real idea of what her budget looks like on the day by day 


General comments 
* Most expenses are on food and coffee that she could otherwise get elsewhere 
* Has not attempted tracking expenses before since would have to do it too frequently 
* Doesn’t necessarily want to check all the time because then she knows how much spending 
* Avoids seeing bad feedback 
* Uses bank app to look at expenses every 2 weeks 
* Variable amounts of time being tracked 
* Seems unlikely that she would want to record her
