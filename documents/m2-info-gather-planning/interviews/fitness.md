# Finance Interviews

## Person 1
##### Amanda
* 21 years old
* Female
* Class of 2021
* Information Science
* Student

Do you have any current strength goals? What are they?
 * Yes, general goals in legs, abs/core strength, shoulders, arms… every body part. Main focus on legs. Not really stamina.

How frequently do you workout? 
 * In the past few weeks, not often at all; pretty infrequent… but in the past / peak, I went 5 times a week. Not there yet this semester though.

What do your exercise/strength training habits look like? 
 * If I end up going 5 times a week, I try to do a different muscle group everyday. So leg day, back/bicep, chest/tricep/abs, a class (spinning, zumba, yoga). That’s the ideal.
But often times if it’s not 5 times a week, I just do legs, a class, back/biceps. Then the other muscle groups get pushed back to another week.

How do you measure progress for strength goals? 
 * I measure it in term of weight increases (the weights used).
Progress photos; I don’t weigh myself b/c it’s not a good indicator of strength goals
The ideal is taking the photo at the same time every week and seeing if there are any physical changes.

Do you currently keep track of your strength exercises in any way? What do you like and dislike about this method?
Do you ever forget to track your exercises?
 * I just use “Notes” on the iPhone. I don’t like it b/c it’s just me typing out every single thing on a new line.
Good thing is it’s very simple and I can just manually type my own things, with whatever name I want.
But I don’t like it b/c it’s hard to track the progression; it’s only in terms of numbers so there’s no way to see how it’s changed.
I’m pretty good at tracking it b/c I refer to it every time I go to the gym to refer back to what weights I used the last time.
 * So I’m pretty good at tracking it but it’s just text, so visuals and graphs would be cool.

When do you track these exercises (while at gym/after gym etc.) and how long does it take? 
Definitely at the gym b/c afterward I would forget
 * It takes like 2 minutes max. I do it at every step of the way: so if I use this machine first, I put the weight at whatever it is. Check my phone to see if the weight went lower or above, and then i’ll change it. 
For example, if it’s 100 but then I use 90, I’ll use an → to do 90. It only takes a couple seconds.

What variables do you need to track for strength goals? (reps, weight, etc)  What mechanism are you currently using to track this?
 * Reps/sets, and weight. More qualitative is photos.

What issues do you face with tracking your strength goals?
 * There are no reminders or notifications b/c this is specifically on a Notes app. There’s no way to notify me or have any sort of interaction other than when I input stuff.
Although I like the ability to have preset workouts, I think a lot of these are common ones, so it would be cool to already have some in mind to choose from, and also get ideas from other workouts. But I haven’t really found a workout app that encompasses both of those.
What happens when you don’t meet your goals?
When I don’t meet my goals, I am disappointed in myself and that’s basically it.

Why do you track your strength goals?
 * If I don’t track them then I don’t have numbers and it’s hard to see progress. It’s also difficult to know when/where I left off. 
I haven’t gone in a while so I totally forgot the numbers. So having them there is useful so I know where to start at weights/reps and stuff.
In general I also forget what to do in my workouts, so it’s very clear. I don’t have to spend time at the gym thinking about what to do; the information is already there.
It just helps me understand where I’m at and where I have left to go.
I don’t really set goals though; I don’t have goal weights; it’s currently just what I am right now. But I probably should start making goals.

Is there anything you can think of that would help you reach your goals?
 * Yeah, I think notifications are really helpful.
Support from friends as well, is also motivating. Not to compare, but to motivate and cheer people on. I like sharing my goals with other people. I’ll send a photo to my mom for example when I’m at the gym.
Photos are honestly really motivating to see how far you’ve come / how far yet you have to go.
It’s cool to see like “wow this was only a semesters work”. Looking at #s is not helpful, so anything visual is good.

Have you tried any apps in the past for this purpose?
 * Not that I can name of; I downloaded a few fitness ones on the app store but they seemed masculine oriented
They had pics of muscular men so I didn’t identify with any of these apps.
They seemed more for people who are like “lift men” so I didn't want to use those.
I used fitbit but it only tracks steps and heart rate and calories; I like using that as a basis of knowing when I reached steps a day but it doesn’t relate to strength training. You can log strength training, but it’s too much effort.
