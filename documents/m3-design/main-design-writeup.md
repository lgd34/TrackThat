# Milestone 3: Design

## Brainstorming

To conduct our brainstorming, we aggregated ideas and conducted market research. Some of our raw ideas and mentions included concepts like:

 * Daily Dashboard
   * Tile format 
   * Each tile is expandable 
   * Like blackboard announcements
 * Way to compartmentalize different kinds of things to track when you initially download the app 
   * Topics Grids
 * Can be used to track multiple things → Accessible toggle
   * Variables + subvariables 
 * Is customizable yet not complicated → Not too many options, or ability to add more options/fields
   * Reminder toggle
   * User sets when to receive 
 * Visualizes quantitative data
   * Line Charts (weight use over time) 
 * Do we let them choose the chart (Bar, circle, line)?
    * Increment/Decrement with arrows 
    * Show targets 
 * Something you can take notes with
   * Allows entries
   * Sticky Notes/Google Keep	
   * Sticky Note per each separate topic 
   * Can customize each sticky note


### Inspiration
We drew inspiration from pre-existing mobile and desktop applications where users have to keep track of information.

## Prototyping

### Paper Prototype

### Low-Fidelity Prototype

We tested our paper prototype with five people from our target group. 
After testing, we found we need to:
1. Improve the language of our app. 
	- Our language of "categories" and "items" were ambiguous and our users were not sure what to input. 
	- The conversational style of our application was too robotic/formal.
2. Add more navigational buttons, like "back" and "edit" buttons.
3. Make the flow less heavy.
	- Users felt it took too many clicks to input tracking. They had to create a category, create an item, and then an entry.

We also learned that users did not care that much about creating goals. They were satisfied with tracking progress and inputting data, but creating goals to meet were not as important.


### Wireframes

## Rationale

After user research and interface iterations, we decided on a flow that both utilizes friendly human language and reduces the number of steps necessary for functionaltiy. Specifically, we:
1. Put all primary components visible at once on a dashboard, reducing the number of clicks/taps necessary to start tracking.
	- We came to this format by paralleling the tracking to Google Drive, where "Collections" are folders and "Trackers" are files.
	- Initially, a user would be required to create a "category" in order to create an "item". For example, they would have to create a larger category of "Fitness" to track "weight." We de-coupled this so that user can create "Trackers" without necessarily creating a "Collection," but can add to a collection if they choose. 
2. Created a conversation between the user and interface.
	- Instead of generic and robotic labels that would confuse the user, we ask the user questions to create trackers and input information.
	- We tried to ask questions in our language, like "What do you want to track?" instead of just telling the user what to do to enforce that conversational tone. 
3. Simplified the information display.
	- Throughout the planning process, we found ourselves straying away from the MVP and adding unnecessary features. We were trying to figure out how to add a "goals" feature, but when thinking back to our users, none of our users specified that they wanted to track goals. They wanted to focus on progress. To meet our value propositions, we changed the "goals" feature from a numerical calculation to a simple notification with text that they could modify themselves and look at for moral support.


## Revisions
We will complete revisions to Milestone 2 in class on Monday 10/22.
